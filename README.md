The Canny edge detection algorithm typically involves the following steps:
1. Convert the image to grayscale
2. Apply Gaussian smoothing to the image to reduce noise
3. Calculate the gradient of the image using Sobel filters
4. Apply non-maximum suppression to thin the edges
5. Apply hysteresis thresholding to determine the strength of the edges
